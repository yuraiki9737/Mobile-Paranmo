# Mobile-Paranmo
Welcome to Mobile Development repository of Paranmo Application (From Bangkit Capstone Project Team C22-PS020)!

See the link of C22-PS020: [Team Repository](https://github.com/yuraiki9737/Paranmo)

This repository is managed by the Mobile Development members:

*  (MD) A2304G2604 - Givar Elva Rizky Hana'An 
*  (MD) A2006F0498 - Alsy Taqiya Herasafitri

## The Process
In developing this application, there are some processes that we had done:
1. User Research
2. Design Thinking
3. UI Design and Prototyping
4. Usability Testing
5. Developing and Integrating
6. Testing

## User Research
The user research was done by all of the team members. We did the research by asking some people and evaluating some comments on the existing similiar applications. Then we gained some user's pain points. The pain points were crucial part to know what must be done for the better development. We also made a competitive research.

## Design Thinking
In design thinking process, all of the team members did some stuffs, such as "Define Stage" which was done by determining Pain Points, How-Might-We, and Affinity Diagram. Besides, there was "Ideate Stage" which was done by brainstorming ideas based on HMW ans Solution Idea. After that, we did the "Prioritization Idea", which was done by determining which features should be developed first based on the prioritization. After that, the MD member did the User Flow to make a clear and understandable flow of the application.

## UI Design and Prototyping
In the prototyping process, the MD members designed the user interface of Paranmo application. The process was done by determining the Style Guide also, so that the application design looks consistent.

## Usability Testing
The usability testing was done to test the prototype tha have has made before. We did the usability testing by using Maze. After spreading the Maze link to a lot of UI/UX and other groups, we gained 114 testers in total. We gained a lot of feedbacks.

For the usability testing gained from Maze, here is the link:

After that, we classified the answeres to ease the development process.

## Developing and Integrating
In this step, we develop the application by integrating all of the technology aspects (Mobile Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing). This application is still in the beta version. Futher development for some features will soon be launched.
